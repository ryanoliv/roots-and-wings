Experts like Gabor Maté and Bessel van der Kolk have delved into the way that play helps children develop vital emotional regulation and resilience, the absence of which can be a significant impediment to effective learning. But affective factors like these are only the beginning. Researchers have repeatedly discovered that children acquire and build their language capacity, creativity, social competence, and executive functions — the neural circuitry that manages such cognitive processes as problem-solving, planning, organisation, time management, and the ability to moderate one's emotions — through their play."
