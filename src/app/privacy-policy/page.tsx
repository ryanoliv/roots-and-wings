        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy (the “Policy”)
          explains how we maintain the privacy of your personal data and
          explains your legal rights and our legal obligations in accordance
          with the Data Protection Act 2018 (the “Act”) and the General Data
          Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2018 (collectively, the “GDPR
          Regulations”). We take our responsibilities under the Act seriously.
          We recognise the importance of the personal data entrusted to us and
          believe that it is our responsibility to properly manage, protect, and
          process your personal data. Please take a moment to read our Policy so
          that you know and understand the purposes for which we collect, use,
          and disclose your personal data. This Policy supplements but does not
          supersede nor replace any consents you may have previously provided to
          us in respect of your personal data, and your consents herein are
          additional to any rights which any of us may have at law to collect,
          use, and/or disclose your personal data. If you have any questions or
          concerns about this Policy or our privacy practices, we welcome you to
          contact us by email at abvrootsandwings@gmail.com.

        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
          This Policy applies to the collection, holding, processing, use,
          and/or transfer of your personal data under the Act. As a general
          principle, you will provide us with your Personal Information entirely
          voluntarily; there are generally no detrimental effects for you if you
          choose not to consent or to provide Personal Information. There are,
          however, circumstances in which we cannot take action without certain
          of your Personal Information, for example, because this Personal
          Information is required to process your service instructions or
          product orders, provide you with access to a blog or newsletter, or to
          carry out a legally required compliance screening. In these cases, it
          will unfortunately not be possible for us to provide you with what you
          request without the relevant Personal Information and we will
          endeavour to notify you accordingly. We will not be liable to you for
          the disclosure of Personal Information if, as shown by clear and
          convincing evidence, the Personal Information: (a) is generally known
          to the public at the time of disclosure by you; or (b) becomes
          generally known to the public through no fault of ours; or (c) was
          lawfully in our possession prior to you disclosing such Personal
          Information; or (d) is subject to applicable laws or a valid court
          order requiring disclosure of such Personal Information.

        <h2>Retention of Information</h2>
        <p>
          If any of the personal data that you have provided to us changes, for
          example, if you change your email address or if you wish to cancel any
          request you have made of us, or if you become aware we have any
          inaccurate personal data about you, please let us know by sending an
          email to abvrootsandwings@gmail.com. We will not be responsible for

          provide to us. Under the Act, your Personal Information will be
          deleted when it is no longer reasonably required for the permitted
          purposes or you withdraw your consent (where applicable) and we are
          not legally required or otherwise permitted to continue storing such
          data. We will, in particular, retain your Personal Information where
          required for us to assert or defend against legal claims until the end
          of the relevant retention period or until the claims in question have

        <h2>Privacy Security</h2>
        <p>
          In order to maintain the security of your Personal Information under
          the Act, we have taken reasonable methods to prevent unauthorised
          access and maintain accuracy of all Personal Information collected by
          our website. Physical and technical methods of protection include
          limited access by internal personnel to your Personal Information on a
          need-to-know basis, and password-protecting documents or logs that
          contain Personal Information. By remaining on our website, you
          acknowledge that transmission of information over the internet is not
          fully secure and is at your own risk. We cannot therefore guarantee
          that any information you submit to us will be accessible only to us as
          the intended recipients. We shall, however, do our best to protect
          your Personal Information. Nevertheless, if there is a security breach
          on behalf of an unauthorised party, you agree to indemnify us and hold
          us harmless for any and all claims against the unauthorised party. We
          shall endeavour to prevent the introduction of malware, malicious
          code, and viruses (“Viruses”) to our website and our users. Due to the
          inherent nature of the internet, we are, however, unable to guarantee
          or warrant that our websites, content, products, or services are
          completely free from Viruses. We will not be liable for any damages or
          harm relating to Viruses that may arise after use of our website or
          services or products purchased on it. You agree to take responsibility
          with reasonable measures to prevent the intrusion of Viruses onto your
          hardware and software, and by taking appropriate steps to ensure your
          computer and web browser are not exposed to the risk of interference
          or damage from Viruses. You acknowledge that your use of our website,
          products, and services is completely voluntary. As such, you shall
          indemnify us and hold us and our agents and affiliates harmless for
          any damages or injury that may arise from your use of our website,
          products, and services, which include, but are not limited to, issues
          regarding the confidentiality and security of your Personal
          Information.
